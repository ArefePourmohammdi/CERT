## Abstract
The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) plays a crucial role in maintaining the cybersecurity posture of organizations. This report delves into the history, structure, roles, and challenges faced by CERTs in the modern digital landscape. By analyzing key aspects such as incident handling, vulnerability mitigation, and policy implementation, we explore how CERTs operate effectively within organizations. The report also evaluates current CERT models and discusses collaboration, staffing strategies, and communication practices. Insights are drawn from real-world case studies to highlight the importance of CERTs in enhancing cybersecurity resilience.
